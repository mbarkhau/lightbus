# What is Lightbus?

Lightbus is a powerful but intuitive messaging client for your
backend services. Lightbus is for use with Python, but can
communicate with services written in other languages.

Lightbus uses Redis 5 as its underlying transport, although support
for other platforms may be added in future.

**Lightbus is under active development and is still pre-release.**

## How Lightbus works

Lightbus provides you with two tools:

1. A **client** with which to fire events,
  and make remote procedure calls (RPCs) from anywhere within your
  codebase.
1. A **stand-alone Lightbus worker process** in which you can setup
  event listeners. This process will also respond to RPCs calls.

For example, you could architect an e-commerce system as follows:

![A simple Lightbus deployment][simple-processes]

In this example:

* **Django** serves pages using data from the database
* **Django** performs remote procedure calls to resize images. The Lightbus
  worker in the **image resizing service** performs the image resize and responds.
* The **price monitoring service** fires `price_monitor.competitor_price_changed` events
* The Lightbus worker in the **online shop web service** listens for
  `price_monitor.competitor_price_changed` events and updates prices in the
  database accordingly.


See the [anatomy lesson] for further discussion.

## Designed for ease of use

Lightbus is designed to be intuitive and familiar,
and common problems are caught with
clear and helpful error messages.

For example, a naïve authentication API:

```python3
class AuthApi(Api):
    user_registered = Event(parameters=('user', 'email'))

    class Meta:
        name = 'auth'

    def check_password(self, user, password):
        return (
            user == 'admin'
            and password == 'secret'
        )
```

This can be called as follows:

```python3
import lightbus

bus = lightbus.create()

is_valid = bus.auth.check_password(
    user='admin',
    password='secret'
)
# is_valid is True
```

You can also listen for events:

```python3
# bus.py
import lightbus

bus = lightbus.create()

# Our event handler
def send_signup_email(event_message,
                      user, email):
    send_mail(email,
        subject=f'Welcome {user}'
    )

# Setup our listeners on startup
@bus.client.on_start()
def on_start():
    bus.auth.user_registered.listen(
        send_signup_email,
        listener_name="send_signup_email"
    )
```

## Where to start?

Starting with the **[tutorials] section** will give you a
**practical introduction** to Lightbus.
Alternatively, the **[explanation] section** will give you a
grounding in the high level **concepts and theory**.

Start with whichever section suits you best. You should
ultimately look through both sections for a complete understanding.

In addition, the [how to] section gives solutions to common 
use cases, and the [reference] section provides detailed 
technical information regarding specific features.
